#	Project Proposal Guideline

You/We can start by doing the following.
+ Create a GitHub repository for the project. Choose an appropriate name.
+ Use Markdown to create a project proposal to describe what you want to do with me, including project specifications, and include URL links to data sets that we can use.
	- Write what you want to do in 2-3 sentences as a project blurb/summary.
		* Highlight this in bold.
	- Describe what you want to do 1-2 pages (equivalent, when printed out). Include diagrams, if necessary.
	- Do basic project management.
		* Craft a timeline for the project, the budget and timing constraints that you/we have.
		* Use Gantt charts to describe timing constraints.
	- Create a list of tasks in the project description that you think we need.
		* We will probably have to refine this, and break it down some more.
		* Allocate tasks between us, based on availability (in terms of time), and our strengths and weaknesses.
	- Specify the kind of software development methodology, and/or electronic or embedded system design methodology, that you want to use.
		*If we disagree, I will explain why we need better methodologies for better productivity.
	- Explain why is the project important, and how this project (if and when completed successfully) can help people.
	- You can include other people in the project, and add them as collaborators.
